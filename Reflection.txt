    <p style="color: #2C6485"> <b> During 2nd Quarter I was able to expand my knowledge about CSS even more. The lessons we tackled with Ms. Uminga were the ones I was able to apply such as in lesson 7 with the float tag. Along with my past experiences recreating an improved website was much easier though, troubleshooting is still a bit difficult I'm slowly getting the hang of it. While creating this Portfolio for the 2nd Quarter I was able to look back at all the activites, events, and topics that we went through. I hope I reach my goal in 2nd Quarter which is to get higher grades in ICT and in other subjects. Overall, 2nd Quarter might just have most of the most fondest memories during my grade 9 school year as it had the most events, some of which was: The historical figure, booklandia, Intramurals, and the practice for the upcoming V-Pop. I hope I can further improve my coding skills and continue persevering. </b> </p>
