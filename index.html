<h1> Hi There, </h1>
<p>  I'm Alniyah Naureen C. Guardacasa, I am a student at Las Pinas City National Science Highschool and I'm 14 and turning 15 in January! Some of my other information is in my 1st quarter Portfolio so be sure to check it out. <br> <br>

 It's my second time making a portfolio and I think I've improved a bit more compared to before. I also improved as a person
as of 2nd Quarter since I've been able to build up my confidence thanks to my family, friends, and the new experiences because of this, I was able to join more events, meet more people and in general just enjoy. Even though school is hard and it does sometimes mess with your mind and how you perceive things it's still important to enjoy what you are doing. I'm so glad that I'm able to incorporate that through my highschool life.
